      "id": "REQ-23",
      "text": "Add a subtle, smooth open/close transition for the Program Detail drawer/sheet (frontend/src/components/program-calendar/ProgramDetailDrawer.tsx) so that when a program is opened from the calendar or programs list, the panel animates in with a gentle fade + slide (slide from the right on desktop, slide up from the bottom on mobile) and animates out on close.",
      "target": "frontend",
      "source": {
        "messageIds": [

      },
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Opening Program Detail animates in smoothly (fade + directional slide) and feels responsive (no jank).",
        "Closing Program Detail animates out smoothly (reverse animation) without leaving the UI in a visually broken state.",
        "Desktop/right drawer uses a horizontal slide-in; mobile/bottom sheet uses a vertical slide-up motion.",
        "Animation respects reduced-motion preferences (if the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled, the animation is disabled or significantly minimized).",
        "No edits are made to any files under frontend/src/components/ui; the animation is applied via composition (e.g., className) in ProgramDetailDrawer."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any read-only shadcn UI sources under frontend/src/components/ui; apply transitions by composing/adding classes in app-level components only.",
    "Keep the backend unchanged; this is a UI-only enhancement."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Redesigning the Program Detail content layout or changing the information shown in the drawer.",
    "Adding new program fields, backend APIs, or changing program selection/navigation logic."
