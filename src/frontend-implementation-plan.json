      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Opening Program Detail animates in smoothly (fade + directional slide) and feels responsive (no jank).",
        "Closing Program Detail animates out smoothly (reverse animation) without leaving the UI in a visually broken state.",
        "Desktop/right drawer uses a horizontal slide-in; mobile/bottom sheet uses a vertical slide-up motion.",
        "Animation respects reduced-motion preferences (if the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled, the animation is disabled or significantly minimized).",
        "No edits are made to any files under frontend/src/components/ui; the animation is applied via composition (e.g., className) in ProgramDetailDrawer."

          "description": "Implement smooth open/close transitions by composing Tailwind/tailwindcss-animate classes onto SheetContent (no edits under frontend/src/components/ui). Keep the drawer mounted during close so animate-out can run (e.g., store the last non-null program in local state and delay unmounting until after the animation duration). Apply fade + slide-in/out using data-state driven classes, selecting slide direction based on the existing isMobile logic (desktop: from/to right; mobile: from/to bottom). Add reduced-motion handling using Tailwind motion-reduce variants to disable/minimize animation for users with prefers-reduced-motion enabled."
