  "architectural_notes": [
    "Program Calendar UI must be full-width and dominant (not sidebar), with responsive design: desktop calendar grid + mobile agenda list view.",
    "Calendar supports switchable views: Monthly / Weekly / Agenda.",
    "Provide filter controls above the calendar: Unit/Divisi, PIC, Status, Priority.",
    "Each date shows a badge count of programs; clicking a date opens a right-side detail panel (drawer) or modal.",
    "Clicking a program opens a detail drawer with description, period, PIC, progress visualization, status, and an Edit action.",
    "UI styling direction: prioritize readability (larger fonts, generous spacing, clear contrast), card-based layout, soft shadows, consistent icons, and restrained status colors.",
    "Calendar UI polish direction confirmed: more spacious layout (larger spacing), softer colors, larger/more readable typography, simpler agenda layout; adjust calendar grid density (tighter vs looser) as part of this refinement.",
    "Avoid horizontal scrolling to access program details; ensure details are accessible without shifting/scrolling sideways (e.g., responsive drawer/modal or inline details on smaller screens) and improve overall scroll smoothness/usability.",
    "Add a subtle smooth open/close transition for the program detail drawer/modal/sheet to improve perceived UX polish.",
    "Support automatic reminders for calendar items (e.g., 1 day and 3 hours before start/deadline)."
