# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the Program Calendar tab’s UI across Month/Week/Day/Agenda into a clean, minimal, distraction-free presentation while keeping all existing behavior and functionality unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Restyle the Program Calendar header and surrounding layout to remove visually loud treatments (e.g., gradients, heavy shadows) and use clean typography, subtle borders, and restrained spacing.
- Simplify Month and Week grid day cells by reducing visual chrome (less shadow/borders/rounding and toned-down hover effects) while preserving date number, today highlight, out-of-month dimming (Month), and category presence indicators.
- Make Day and Agenda views more compact and consistent by simplifying list rows (reduced padding, less icon prominence, minimal decoration) while keeping the same item types, displayed core fields, click-to-open behaviors, and English empty states.
- Simplify the filters/controls area above the calendar into a more compact, less “card-like” layout without removing any existing filters, controls, reset behavior, or the (minimal) category legend.

**User-visible outcome:** The Program Calendar looks cleaner and less visually dense in all modes, while all existing controls (navigation, filters, view switching, reminders toggle, density), interactions (day panel, program detail drawer), and English text remain exactly as before.
