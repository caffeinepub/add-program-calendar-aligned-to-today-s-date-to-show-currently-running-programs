  "summary": "Diff implements several UI simplifications for the Program Calendar (minimal category legend, simplified DayCell used by Month/Week grids, compact-looking controls for view switching and grid density, and refreshed Day detail panel / program detail drawer). However, evidence suggests Day/Agenda list rows may still use prominent icons and a thick colored left bar, which conflicts with the requested “minimal decoration” requirement for those views.",

      "id": "REQ-31",
      "requirement": "Make the Day and Agenda views more compact and consistent by simplifying list items (reduce padding, reduce icon prominence, remove unnecessary visual decoration) while preserving essential information and click-to-open Program Detail behavior.",
      "reason": "DayListView/AgendaListView still appear to use prominent lucide icons and a thick left colored indicator bar (w-1 with full-height/rounded) and relatively large padding (p-3), which conflicts with the AC guidance to avoid large icons and thick left borders and to reduce decoration.",

      "id": "REQ-29",
      "requirement": "Simplify the overall visual presentation of the Program Calendar tab header and surrounding layout to a minimal, distraction-free style while keeping all existing functionality unchanged.",
      "reason": "ProgramCalendarTab.tsx is truncated in the diff summary, so it’s not possible to verify from provided evidence that the header/surrounding layout removed visually loud styling (e.g., gradients/heavy shadows) and moved to subtle borders/typography, while preserving all interactions.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-32",
      "requirement": "Simplify the filter and control areas above the calendar to reduce perceived complexity (compact layout, fewer heavy card/shadow treatments), without removing any filter fields or controls.",
      "reason": "ProgramCalendarTab.tsx (where filters/controls live) is truncated, so the diff summary does not provide enough evidence to confirm that Unit/Division, PIC, Status, Priority, Reset Filters, grid density (Month/Week), view mode switcher, reminders toggle, and the (now minimal) legend are all still present and that the area’s visual chrome was reduced.",
