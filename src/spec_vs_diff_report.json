  "summary": "The diff implements most of the Program Calendar redesign: new Month/Week grid views with day badges, an Agenda list view, a view switcher with mobile defaulting to agenda, day detail sheet, program detail sheet with progress/status/priority styling helpers, and range-based data loading via a new React Query hook. However, based on the truncated evidence, some required behaviors (notably filter reset UI and edit-flow wiring/refresh) cannot be conclusively verified. There are also unrelated dashboard changes (DashboardOverview) that were not requested and conflict with the “no new unrelated dashboard features” non-goal.",

      "reason": "ProgramCalendarTab imports ProgramFormDialog and maintains edit-related state, and ProgramDetailDrawer accepts an onEdit callback, but the provided snippets are truncated before showing (1) an Edit button invoking onEdit, (2) ProgramFormDialog opening with the selected program, and (3) post-save invalidation/refetch to refresh calendar views.",
