  "summary": "The diff addresses most requirements related to fixing the KPI form 'invalid record' error. Key changes include: numeric type validation and BigInt conversion for target/realization values (REQ-2, REQ-3), enhanced error logging with detailed console output and user-friendly toast messages (REQ-6), and improvements to team member dropdown handling (REQ-5). However, evidence for Program Terkait dropdown mapping (REQ-4) is incomplete due to file truncation, and validation of dropdown serialization to backend format cannot be fully verified.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Verify Program Terkait (Related Program) dropdown correctly maps the selected program to the backend-expected format (program ID or reference)",
      "reason": "The diff shows KpiFormDialog.tsx uses 'relatedProgramId' and converts it with BigInt(Number(formData.relatedProgramId)), but the file is truncated before the submit handler. Cannot verify if the program ID is correctly serialized to match backend KPI.relatedProgramId field type or if there are any special transformations needed.",
