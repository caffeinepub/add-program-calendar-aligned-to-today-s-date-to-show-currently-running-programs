  "summary": "Diff implements a new SHQ-style global palette (OKLCH CSS variables), adds a navy gradient background utility, updates app shell (App/Dashboard/Header/Footer/Login/Profile Setup) to use the new theme, and introduces a centered translucent “pill” top tab navigation component. However, the new top nav changes tab labels away from the existing names, and the diff includes multiple non-requested functional enhancements across several feature tabs/hooks beyond the visual/layout scope.",
