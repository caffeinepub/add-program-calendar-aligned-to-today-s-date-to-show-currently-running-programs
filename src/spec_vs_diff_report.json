  "summary": "The diff shows work toward a file-upload-only avatar flow in TeamMemberFormDialog (uploadImage -> hosted URL stored in formData.avatar with success/error toasts). However, due to truncation, it’s not verifiable that the manual URL input UI and all manual-URL-related logic/validation were fully removed, nor that upload/submit disable protections remain intact. Two non-requested metadata/docs files were also modified with broader/unrelated product descriptions.",

      "requirement": "Remove the manual photo URL input option (the 'Or enter photo URL manually' label and the avatar URL <Input>) from the Team Member create/edit dialog UI.",
      "reason": "The provided diff excerpt for TeamMemberFormDialog.tsx does not show the form JSX where the label/input would be removed; thus removal cannot be confirmed from the truncated content.",

      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not show the full submit validation logic, nor does it show whether isValidUrl usage (or equivalent URL validation) was removed; cannot confirm from truncated content.",

      "requirement": "Remove now-unused manual-URL related logic/imports (e.g., handleAvatarChange, URL validation errors for manual entry, isValidUrl import) while keeping upload error handling/progress/preview intact.",
      "reason": "The excerpt shows the new file upload handler, but does not include enough of the file to verify that all manual-URL code paths and imports were removed (and whether any URL-specific validation/error state remains).",
